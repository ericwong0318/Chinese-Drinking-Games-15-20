Rule of the game 
1. Players extend both hands and reveal either a closed fist (representing a value of 0) or open hand (value of 5) at the same time, much like you would in a game of rock, paper, scissors. However, at the moment the hands are deployed, the player calls out their prediction of the total value of both hands, which could be 0, 5, or 10. 

2. If the player guesses correctly, he gets to call again, at which point every player has the option of changing their hands. If the player guesses incorrectly, the call goes to the next in line. 

3. The game ends when one player manages two consecutive correct guesses.
